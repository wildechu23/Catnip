Optimal Combination Statchecker
- Check combinations of people and W-L
- Can expand history to see all games - maybe give a link but league match history is down - color red for losses and green for wins
- Can choose roles for people(how bout multiple role selections?)
- Can choose 2+ people(implement 2 for now, but code so 3+ can be added)
- Server-side database for match history?
- Start with me n rayat for testing
